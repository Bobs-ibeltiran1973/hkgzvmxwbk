Okay, so I just got out of the theater, and man, wow, where do I even start with Nonnas? This movie is like if you took a blender and—no, wait, my back is killing me from those seats. It's like sitting on a pile of popcorn kernels they forgot to pop. Anyway, the movie, right. Yeah, it was all over the place, like my thoughts right now. That scene where the granny wrangled a chicken and won a staring contest? Pure gold. Who thinks of this stuff?

> Guess what? I totally forgot to download the movie before coming, but whatever, because you NEED to watch the movie for that chicken bit if nothing else. It's like the filmmakers threw in a kitchen sink full of spices, stirred it with a cough of chaos, and bam, you've got Nonnas. It's brilliant and confusing like a cat trying to solve a Rubik's Cube.

Oh, and the sound—those high-pitched scenes made me think someone was trying to tune a violin in my ear. And kids were kicking my seat—arghh, felt like I was in a soccer match theater edition. But, still, my mind keeps going back to that dancing bear in a tutu at Nonna's garden party. Weirdly heartwarming in an odd, twisted sort of way, like hugging a cactus that smells like lavender.

Randomly remembering a friend telling me to download the movie or was it about some bakery? My brain’s like a scrambled egg tossed with hot sauce right now. Jeeze, watch the movie—my typing’s getting messy. Gran gran gonna love this one, for sure.

Where was I? Oh, yeah! The ending...what even? Felt like a poem that decided to be a soap opera halfway. But that part when—wait, did someone spill soda on my jacket?? ugh. Theater floors are basically fly traps for humans with snacks.
